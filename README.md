# Quantum Finance Benchmarks

Welcome to the quantum finance benchmarks.
This repository is made of three sub-modules each reflecting an area where quantum comuting has the potential to improve a computational task:
- [Machine Learning](https://link_here),
- [Optimization](https://github.com/qiskit-community/finance_benchmarks/blob/main/optimization/README.md), and 
- [Simulation](https://github.com/qiskit-community/finance_benchmarks/blob/main/simulation/algorithms/README.md).

## Vision

The repository tracks the progress of quantum computing for applications relevant to finance.
It is made of libraries of community-proposed benchmark problems and corresponding solutions to these problems.
Solutions to the benchmark problems may be run on any type of quantum hardware or simulator, e.g., superconducting qubits, annealers, or trapped ions.
The progress of quantum computing towards large problems is tracked by performance metrics defined in each sub-module.
Everybody is welcome to propose benchmark problems that they believe are relevant for quantum computing in finance as well as new solutions to existing benchmarks.

## How to contribute

The proposed solutions to a benchmark problem may either be executed on simulators or hardware.
The platform on which the solution was obtained must be clearly indicated.
Refer to the READMEs of the three sub-modules for detailed instructions on how to contribute:
